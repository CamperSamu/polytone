- Added custom_block_set_types object type. Can define custom block sets (sound groups like the ones that vanilla wooden blocks use
- With those you can now change open and close sounds for doors, trapdoors, buttons and pressure plates
- Done via a "block_set_type" field in block_modifiers
- Renamed some folders. Old folder names wll still work but new ones are preferred:
    - "block_properties" -> "block_modifiers"
    - "fluid_properties" -> "fluid_modifiers"
    - "dimension_effects" -> "dimension_modifiers"
    - "biome_effects" -> "biome_modifiers"
    - "sound_types" -> "custom_sound_types"
- better error handling for compound colormaps
